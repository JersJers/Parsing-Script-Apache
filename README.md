# Parsing-Script-Apache


As an Information Technology Intern at StoryCorps, I spearheaded a project to parse a log file from an Apache HTTP Server using Python. This involved extracting and analyzing critical data from extensive log files to identify patterns, trends, and potential issues affecting server performance and security.

Key responsibilities and achievements:

* Developed a Python script to efficiently parse and analyze Apache log files, identifying key metrics such as traffic sources, response times, error rates, and user behavior patterns.
* Summarized the findings in an executive summary, highlighting crucial insights and actionable recommendations.
* Presented the executive summary to the CEO, CFO, stakeholders, and the entire company, providing a clear and concise overview of server performance and security status.
* Demonstrated the impact of the findings on the organizationâ€™s IT infrastructure, suggesting improvements for enhanced performance and security.
* Collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure the implementation of recommended changes, resulting in improved server efficiency and reduced downtime.
* This project showcased my ability to leverage Python for data analysis and my capacity to communicate technical findings to non-technical stakeholders effectively.
